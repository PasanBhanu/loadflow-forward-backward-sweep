# Load Flow Calculation using Forward Backward Sweep in Distributed Generation Integrated Radial Distribution System.
Load flow analysis, which is one of the most important approaches in investigating problems in a power system, gives insights of the systemâ€™s steady state performance. Many computer-based algorithms for solving load flow problems have been developed, out of which, many are focused on transmission systems. Owing to some of the special topological properties of distribution systems, application of conventional power flow methods brings out problems. With the increased integration of distribution generation, the distribution system is no longer passive in nature, highlighting the importance of more precise algorithms for load flow analysis. This study proposes an algorithm based on the Forward Backward Sweep Method, which can solve load flow problems in distributed generation integrated radial distribution systems while attempting to model each distribution system component reflecting the system parameters reasonably. Tastings were carried out on standard IEEE 4 Bus system, IEEE 13 Bus system and IEEE 15 Bus system, and the results were analyzed to assess the validity of the proposed algorithm.
